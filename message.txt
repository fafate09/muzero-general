Dear Lizhi Xiong,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the status of my manuscript, "Optimizing Controller Placement for SDN using Self-play Reinforcement,","IJAACS-221951", which I submitted to Int. J. of Autonomous and Adaptive Communications Systems  on 24-Jul-2024.

As I am preparing to defend my thesis this year, I would greatly appreciate any updates regarding the progress of the review process. If there are any additional materials or documents needed to facilitate the review, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Thank you for considering my work for publication in Int. J. of Autonomous and Adaptive Communications Systems and for the effort and time involved in the review process. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Benoudifa Ouafae
